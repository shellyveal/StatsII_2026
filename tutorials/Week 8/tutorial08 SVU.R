# This data set is analyzed by Long (1997).  The response variable has four ordered categories:
# Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Agree, and Strongly Agree in relation to the statement

# "A working mother can establish just as warm and secure a relationship with her children as a mother who does not work."

# The explanatory variables are:
# the year of the survey (1977 or 1989),
# the gender of the respondent,
# the race of the respondent (white or non-white),
# the respondent's age, and
# the prestige of the respondent's occupation (a quantitative variable)

# a) Perform an ordered (proportional odds) logistic regression

# Calculate confidence intervals

# Convert to odds ratio
exp(cbind(OR = coef(ord.log), ci))

# How do we interpret these coefficients?



# b) fit a multinomial logit model

mult.log <- multinom(attitude ~ ., data = workingMoms)

summary(mult.log)

# with Strongly Disagree as reference level for the outcome

# run model
# get p values
# how do we interpret these coefficients?

# calculate predicted probabilities to help our interpretation

# c) Consider gender as an interaction with your other predictors
mult.log.int <- multinom(attitude ~ gender*., data = workingMoms)




# i.e. consider that possibility that gender interacts with the other explanatory variables in influencing the response variable

# What do you find?
